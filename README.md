## WeatherData
This is a project that I created to improve myself, which shows the weather worldwide.

## Description
This project provides information about the weather using the openweathermap API.

## Technologies Used
- Vue3
- TailwindCSS - CSS
- Axios (API)
- Vue Router

## How to Use
When you enter the site, the Geolocation API of Javascript is used to get the data of your current location. Based on this data, the initial display is provided on the Home page. You can make your selection on the map through the Location Maps section with the help of the Google Maps API. Data is received from GMT +1 as the time zone.
Therefore, apart from the automatically incoming data, you can access 96 4-day data by searching from the menu on the right.
